# 16321_python_work

## Anjali Patel - Tetris Game - November 2023.

This game was developed for 'Coureswork 2' in line with the requirements stated for the COMP16321 module at The University of Manchester (of which, as of writing, I am a first-year student at.) 

Tetris has always been a game I had enjoyed playing so I decided to attempt to create and implement my own version of it using the Tkinter GUI library for Python.

This project has been developed using standard Python libraries and requires a pip install of Pillow to run.

## Name
Tetris!

## Description
Based on the retro game of Tetris we all know and love, this is my attempt of implementation of the program within Python, making use of the built in Tkinter library standardly distributed with Python. This project includes the ability to (but not limited to): Play under a given username, save and load games for later play, check the leaderboards, a cheat-code (have fun finding it out!) and a 'boss key' to fool your manager into thinking you are hard at work :wink:.


## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
There are not too many steps to run this program on your own system - if you have Python 3+ installed, you are good to go as this work makes use of soley built-in Python modules.
[-] First, ensure you are Python 3+
[-] Install Pillow library through the command 'pip install pillow'
[-] You should be good to go! Apart from Pillow, the program relies solely on built-in Python libraries
